#### About My Journey - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]

I started my journey back in 2018-2019 with my best friend (well call him Tom). I originally wanted to learn Java as we were both avid Minecraft players and I wanted to help in developing mods. After my first or second go-round with attempting to build a calculator, I moreso gave up. About a year later, I was hanging out with Tom and I was watching him play around with machine learning by having a car go around a track and teach itself to drive around said track. This re-peaked my interest in development and thus we conversed about a language and decided on Python. Python is my mother language and I enjoy using it very much. It's very easy to understand. I digress. After spending a few hours going over some basics, I decided I was smart enough to start building a [Discord Bot using Disnake.py](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/stable/index.html). I was very wrong and it took months for me to grasp that concept. However, now I am able to do quite a lot.

#### What Am I Currently Doing? - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]

Currently, I am focusing more towards the UI/UX and automation side of things. I have:
  - developed my own background task for maintaining a list of all known programming languages that updates every 90 days. This tool will be able to run independently or be imported into your Python project. 
    - > NOTE This tool has been archived. Please see the repo's README.md
  - developed a functioning GUI for a Palindrome Checker
  - And more! See my complete list of works below

<b><u>What's The Purpose?</u></b>

Although I have experience in a few languages, scripting or other, I am always learning. Practicing new concepts, learning new ideas, etc. This repository is the foot copy of my journey, showcasing what I've learned and what I'm most proud of.
