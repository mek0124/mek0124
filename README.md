<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

Welcome to my GitHub! This repository serves as a central hub for all my current/released applications, portfolio projects and a glimpse into my journey as a developer. Thanks for stopping by!

<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

I currently study UI/UX development in my freetime. Client-side has always been my *leaned-on* favorite thing to do. I have studied other languages and can work in bash scripts along with python automation and task loop events. As of today, I have:

  - 7+ years in [Python](https://python.org)
  - 4+ years in [JavaScript](https://nodejs.org)
  - 3+ years in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
  - 1+ years in [Bash](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bash-scripting-introduction-to-bash-and-bash-scripting/)
  - < 1 year in [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)

<h2 id="my-journey">My Journey</h2>

I started my journey back in 2016-2017 with my best friend. I originally wanted to learn Java as we were both avid Minecraft players and I wanted to help in developing mods. After my first or second go-round with attempting to build a calculator, I moreso gave up. About a year later, we were hanging out and I was watching my friend play around with machine learning by having a car go around a track and teach itself to drive around said track. This re-peaked my interest in development and thus we conversed about a language and decided on Python. Python is my mother language and I enjoy using it very much. It's very easy to understand and after spending a few hours going over some basics, I decided I was smart enough to start building a [Discord Bot using Disnake.py](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/stable/index.html). I was very wrong and it took months for me to grasp that concept. However, now I am able to do quite a lot.

<h2 id="what-am-i-currently-doing">What Am I Currently Doing?</h2>

I have recently shifted my focus back into a Python lifestyle. In the coming months, I'll be converting most of my applications here on my repo to a python based language and framework, if possible. I have chosen to start my proficiencies in:

<h5>For Python Projects</h5>

- [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) is *"a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with as little code as necessary. It’s the “Command Line Interface Creation Kit”. It’s highly configurable but comes with sensible defaults out of the box."*

- [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/tutorial/) is *"is a Rapid Application Development framework for Python, built by Textualize.io to build sophisticated user interfaces with a simple Python API. Run your apps in the terminal or a web browser!"*

- [PySide6](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/gettingstarted.html#getting-started) is a framework that *"provides Python bindings for the Qt application framework, enabling you to develop full-featured, cross-platform GUI applications with a modern user interface."*

<h5>For Mobile/Web Projects</h5>

- [Expo GO](https://expo.dev/) is *"A free, open-source mobile client app for quickly running and testing React Native projects during development. It allows you to preview your app instantly on your physical device without needing to install native build tools, making it ideal for learning and prototyping."*

- [Tauri + ReactJS](https://tauri.app/) is *"A framework for building lightweight, secure, and cross-platform desktop applications. It combines a Rust core for system-level operations with a web frontend (like ReactJS) rendered by the operating system's native webview, resulting in significantly smaller app sizes compared to similar tools."*

<b><u>What's The Purpose?</u></b>

Although I have experience in a few languages, scripting or other, I am always learning. Practicing new concepts, learning new ideas, etc. This repository serves as the path of my journey, showcasing what I've learned and what I'm most proud of.

> NOTE: At this time, I am still attempting to understand packaging applications down into appropriate executables for my apps. All apps are FOSS and will need to be ran open-source on your system. Please see [How To Install & Run](#how-to-install--run)
