### Introduction

Hi! I'm Mek, and Welcome to My Repo! Here you will find various types of projects that I am either actively developing or actively maintaining.

#### A Little About Me
---

I am currently a full-time online student at the University of Phoenix studying for my Bachelor's in Computer Science focusing in Software Development and Cyber Security. As of today, I have:

  - 6+ years in [Python](https://python.org)
  - 3+ years in [JavaScript](https://nodejs.org)
  - 3+ years in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
  - < 1 year in [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
  - < 1 year in [Bash](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bash-scripting-introduction-to-bash-and-bash-scripting/)
  - Actively learning [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) in current classes

#### About My Journey

I started my journey back in 2018-2019 with my best friend (well call him Tom). I originally wanted to learn Java as we were both avid Minecraft players and I wanted to help in developing mods. After my first or second go-round with attempting to build a calculator, I moreso gave up. About a year later, I was hanging out with Tom and I was watching him play around with machine learning by having a car go around a track and teach itself to drive around said track. This re-peaked my interest in development and thus we conversed about a language and decided on Python. Python is my mother language and I enjoy using it very much. It's very easy to understand. I digress. After spending a few hours going over some basics, I decided I was smart enough to start building a [Discord Bot using Disnake.py](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/stable/index.html). I was very wrong and it took months for me to grasp that concept. However, now I am able to do quite a lot.

#### What Am I Currently Doing?

Currently, I am focusing more towards the UI/UX and automation side of things. I have:
  - developed my own background task for maintaining a list of all known programming languages that updates every 90 days. This tool will be able to run independently or be imported into your Python project.
  - developed a functioning GUI for a Palindrome Checker
  - 

<b><u>What's The Purpose?</u></b>

The purpose is to allow myself the chance to become more rounded with webscraping in Python using [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html) and [BeautifulSoup4](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in addition to Python's [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) library.
