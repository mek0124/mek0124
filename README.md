## A Little About Me

Hi, I am Mek! I have been developing in Python for nearly 8 years, JavaScript for nearly 4, and C# for less than a year. I'm a dedicated developer who can easily spend hours at the computer writing code. Although my expertise mainly lies in Python discord bots and UI/UX (client-side) development, I am passionate about building software that solves real-world problems, experimenting with new technologies, and contributing to free, open-source communities. When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me playing one of my favorite games: Satisfactory or Factorio, crocheting/knitting, or chatting on Discord.

Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate!
