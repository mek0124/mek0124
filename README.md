### Introduction

#### About My Journey

I started my journey back in 2018-2019 with my best friend (well call him Tom). I originally wanted to learn Java as we were both avid Minecraft players and I wanted to help in developing mods. After my first or second go-round with attempting to build a calculator, I moreso gave up. About a year later, I was hanging out with Tom and I was watching him play around with machine learning by having a car go around a track and teach itself to drive around said track. This re-peaked my interest in development and thus we conversed about a language and decided on Python. Python is my mother language and I enjoy using it very much. It's very easy to understand. I digress. After spending a few hours going over some basics, I decided I was smart enough to start building a [Discord Bot using Disnake.py](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/stable/index.html). I was very wrong and it took months for me to grasp that concept. However, now I am able to do quite a lot.

#### What Am I Currently Doing?

Currently, I am focusing more towards the UI/UX and automation side of things. I am actively developing my own background task for maintaining a list of known programming languages that updates once a month. This tool will be able to run independently or be imported into your Python project. Once a public release has been made of this pypi package, I will update the [PyPi Packages](https://github.com/mek0124/PyPiPackages) repository read me file so keep an eye out!
